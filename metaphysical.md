##World view: Metaphysical Components
 
a worldview is characterized by metaphysical components
###Aristotelian-Medieval:
**hylomorphism** (everything is matter and form>
**plurlism**()>2substance)
**teleology**(eveth has goal) 
**plenism**(full, no vacuum in univ)
**heterogeneity**(2 diff regions/laws in univ )
**finite universe**, **monotheism**(1 god)
###Cartesian:
**mechanicisim**(obj compose of interactive matter), 
**dualism**(2 sub), 
**action by contact**, 
**dualistic determinism**, 
**plenism**  
**homogeneity** (1law in univ), 
**inifinite universe**, 
**monotheism**
###Newtonian:
**dynamism**(mastter is extended sub interac through force+contact), 
**dualism**, 
**action at a distance**, (material objects can inflence each other at a distance)
**dualistic determinism**, 
**vacuism**(empty space in univ), 
**homogeneity**, 
**infinite universe**, 
**monotheism**
###Contemporary
**wave-particle duality**, 
**materialism**(1 sub: matter), 
**probabilistic determinism**(all have cause, but same init condition may produce diff results), 
**agnosticism**(dont know god exist or not)

##worldviews
transition from worldview '==>' changes in core metaphysical beliefs
```
metaphysics : a set of views about the world taken as a whole
```
####explicit & implicit
explicit: aristotelian-emdieval and cartesian mosaics  
implicit: newtonian and compemporary

####change in worldviews
as fallibilists, we are *inconsistenct-tolerant*, for we know that truthlike theories can have false consequences

a worldview can be **altered only** with the acceptance of new theories which change our metaphysical assumptions  

according to out current HD method, an individual discovery cannot alter anything unless it is confirmation of some novel prefiction of a new theory

#### Popular history/philosophy of science mythology
Diagnosis:  
1. Q: **science began in 17th century with the likes of Galileo and Newton**  
A:discarding the pre-17th century science would be a grave mistake    
2. Q: **Galileo was a martyr of science who fought against the dogmatism of clergy**    
A:  interpretation is extremely anachronistic for it ignores the fact that theory assessment is always contextual  
3. Q: **The scientific revolution liberated science from religion**  
A:  theology remianed in the mosaic all the way until the 20th century  
4. Q:  **it is accepted in the comtemporary science that God does not exist.**  
A:  accepted view nowadays is that of a gnosticism, not atheism  
5. Q:  **Contemporary science is independent from any metaphysics**  
A:  many metaphysical assumptions are implicit in our contemporary mosaic  
6. Q:  **Science proves its theories by experiments and observations**  
A:  there is no proof in empirical science, only confirmation  
7.  Q:  **The method of science is universal and unchangable**  
A:  theory changeable by fallibilism and because of 3rd law (method employement), method is also changeable  
8.  Q:  **Science is a rational enterprise because of its univeral method**  
A:  science is rational because the process of scientific change obeys certain laws(law of scientific change)  
9.  Q:  **Each succeeding scientific theory contains more and more true claims**  
A:  we are in no posiiton to tell which claims of science are strictly true and which are strictly false. The best we can do is to believe that science progresses towards truth (truthlike)   
10.  Q:  **There is a strict demarcation line between science and pseudoscience**  
A:  the criteria of demarcation between scientific and non-scientific theories are changeable (also have many historical examples)
